# Character Robot Recreation

## PLAY & CHARACTER CHOICE
The play I would choose to base my robot from is from the popular Broadway play Hamilton, which talks about the life of America's founding father Alexander Hamilton. This was my favorite play when I was in high school, and my favorite character was Elizabeth Schuyler, Hamilton's wife.

The scene I would choose is when Eliza finds out that Alexander had cheated on her, where she performs a song while burning his letters. It is such a raw performance of sorrow and betrayal, that I would love to see how this would turn out in a robot, where such emotions have to be programmed first.

## MAKING THE ROBOT

### Technical Features
To mimic Eliza's sadness, one of the main things that would need to be replicated was her eyes, as one of the most telling signs of emotion in humans is the eyes and eyebrows: using servo motors and sticking patches of "hair", it would be possible to replicate the furrowing of brows that show sorrow or frustration.

### Dressing

Copying Eliza's nightgown, I would use a special fabric called tule, or even use a simple pillowcase from my room to drape it over the robot. For the arms, since I would want to make the robot look as human as possible to avoid possible disconnection with the audience, I would cover the hardware with skin colored clay.

### Actions
Coding the actions is possibly the most important part of making a humanoid actor. Even without the use of voice sadness can be implemented using the drooping down of the head, or even through the speed in which they "walk", all of which I showed in my midterm project.
