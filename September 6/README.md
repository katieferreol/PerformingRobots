# Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents: REFLECTION

## PERSONAL SUMMARY

The scholarly article delves into the possibility of sharing a stage with autonomous agents, with the purpose of presenting a more genuine, lifelike presence to the theatre scene. Through combining existing practices of cinema and the innovative ideas of robotics, we are introduced to the concept of puppotics.

## THOUGHTS

It was definitely interesting to learn how physical performing agents create a deeper connection with the audience due to their physical rather than virtual presence. Being part of a generation where everything is online, I rank physical and virtual on nearly the same level. With this fusion of traditional and new performance art practices, it's also interesting to see certain things we have to adjust to in order to adapt to the physical, hardware aspect of the performance, such as making all the instructions explicit.

It was definitely also eye opening to see that these autonomous performing agents are coded to exhibit certain emotions based on their physical and emotional states, which we can simplify as having their own sense of individuality and freedom of choice. The behavior posed by the Woggles relates highly to how we as humans react to one another: observing one, then acting based on the information they gather. It's intriguing to note how they are coded in the image of us humans, as the goal is to cater to the emotions of the audience.

## QUESTIONS

1. Would it have been possible for these autonomous performing agents to cater to the audience's emotions if they were not coded properly? Would the eletronic nature prevent them from fulfilling their purpose?
2. Performance agents are done primarily by humans who know how to gauge the reaction of their audience. In theatre or cinema, where such skill is necessary, would these autonomous agents be successful in replicating these skills?
