# Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs

After escaping the blade of the hunstman, Snow White finds captivity in the seven dwarves house, where they are soon to return after their daily work at the mines. The door opens with a creak: realizing there's no one inside, the Snow White robot slowly veers inside in fear. 

In a line, the seven dwarves move in a jolly, uniform motion as they come back from work. Their faces, maybe shown through a Neopixel, shows which one is which. In the background, the song "Hi Ho!" plays as they approach the house.

Snow White, after hearing the door rustling to open, rushes to hide in a nearby bed. Entering, the dwarves are caught by surprise (symbolized by a slight but sudden veer back) when they see the beautiful robot standing in shock.

Snow White robot tries to plea with the dwarves to let her stay. Her wheels run around the room accompanied with high-pitched babbles.

The seven dwarves gather in a circle and murmur to one another, making a decision. Turning back to Snow White, they let her stay. Snow White runs around the small house in glee, thanking the dwarves for saving her life. She then proceeds to ask their names.

1. Doc: Not sure yet! Maybe something that has to do with his wisdom.
2. Grumpy: Charging forward at Snow White and making a sudden stop, he is the most guarded of the group. Color: Furious Red
3. Happy: Excited to have a new friend in the house, the robot will turn in a continuous circle in glee. Color: Sunny Yellow
4. Sleepy: Walking in a slow motion with head drooped down. Accompanied with snoring sound effects as the robot comes to a stop. Color: Eggshell White
5. Bashful: As the robot makes eye contact with Snow White, he turns around quickly in embarrassment. Color: Tickled Pink
6. Sneezy: As if making a big sneeze, the robot charges backwards suddenly, accompanied with a sneezing sound effect. Color: Mucus Green
7. Dopey: Mimicking his dopey nature, the robot will move its wheels one at a time. Color: Hat Purple

Thinking of a compromise, the dwarves agree that Snow White should to housework with their help. The robots circle around, pushing trash out of the way and into a big pile. In the background, "Whistle While We Work" plays.
