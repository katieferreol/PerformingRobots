# Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs

After escaping the blade of the hunstman, Snow White finds captivity in the seven dwarves house, where they are soon to return after their daily work at the mines. 

In a line, the seven dwarves walk in a jolly, uniform motion. In the background, the song "Hi Ho!" plays as they approach the house.

Snow White, after hearing the door rustling to open, rushes to hide in a nearby bed. Entering, they are caught by surprise when a beautiful woman stands in shock.

Snow White tries to plea with the dwarves to let her stay. She paces around the room accompanied with high-pitched babbles.

The seven dwarves gather and murmur, making a decision. Turning back to Snow White, they let her stay. Snow White runs around the small house in glee, thanking the dwarves for saving her life. She then proceeds to ask their names.
