# MIDTERM PROJECT: Robot with Emotion!

## SUMMARY
My first official robot was made with the focus of exhibiting emotion. This makes use of:

- 1 Neopixel
- 2 DC Motors
- 1 H-Bridge
- 1 External Power Supply

## INSTRUCTIONS
Using the colored buttons, press each to exhibit a different emotion and see the robot move: green for stoic, yellow for happy, blue for sad, red for angry!
