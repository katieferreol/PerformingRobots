# GRUMPY ROBOT

Using the descriptions we learned in class, this is what I would like the Grumpy robot to do:

### SPEED
1. Using the wheels on the DC motors, I will make the robot move forward in an aggressive fashion. Fast, then stop. Repeat this process over and over

### ANGER
2. I will use 2 servo motors and attach little clouds of smoke, which will signify smoke coming out of his ears in frustration.
3. Using another two servo motors, I will attach Grumpyâ€™s arms and cardboard fists, and code them being brought down forcefully to signify his anger.

### EXPRESSIONS
4. Using the neopixel, I will code an angry face, which I have done for my previous midterm project. Maybe I will do more and add more animation to it.
