# The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious 

This reading was very interesting to me, as it discussed the various relationship to which us humans can interact with technology, and who truly is the “slave” in current time. Getting into this reading, my first assumption was thinking that Freudian robots where a new type of technology to be introduced, but reading more into it it seems like the author refers to us as the Freudian robots, where we cannot free her/him/itself from the cybernetic unconscious.

The questions asked in the chapter itself are very intellectually stimulating. The one that caught me attention is: ““is there, or will there ever be, enough similarity to us in our humanoid robots that we will decide to treat them in the same moral ways we treat other people and, in varying degrees, animals?” It’s always the question we ask ourselves, and it finally shows us why we should or shouldn’t hold them in the same regard in the first place.

It reminds me of a concept I am currently learning in my colloquium about “social tipping”, where a society experiences change of a certain belief if enough people take part in it, giving reason as to why our views on LGBTQ+, race, and other things have evolved since the 50’s. However, this is different. The changes in our way of life brought by the technical age have also changed our ways of thinking. 

If we choose to embrace these technologies in the same way that we accepted those, we are endangering ourselves to letting our views be predetermined by this relationship. One reading referenced by the author even begins to consider a possibility where we regard technology as a “god or minor religion,” forcing us to serve these machines that we have made. In addition, it brings into question the political consequences of this mindset, and if our current societal structure can still thrive under this “cybernetic unconscious.”

The age of technology is fast coming and there’s nothing we can do to stop it. In this case, do we stand any chance to fight against the new schools of thought in the years to come, all centered on our dependency on the digital.
